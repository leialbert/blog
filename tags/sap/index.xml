      <description>Overview With SAP_BASIS 7.54 (SAP S/4HANA 1909), SAP delivers new client management tools based on new common architecture. They are a complete redesign of the previous client copy (transactions SCCL, SCC9, SCC5, …). The new tools replace the old client copy and also offer new functions.

The log of the client copy has also been completely revised and is now much more meaningful and easier to read, so that troubleshooting is much easier.</description>
